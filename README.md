# Train

This is my train reservation system I tried to develop for a model railroad club that started in real railroading
with steam historical locomotive and passenger train wagon's.

It should be able to plan a net of train stops like a route planning system and should be able to be used as a planning
system to plan the seat distribution.

This early system was developed with 16Bit MFC using Watcom 10.6 and later was ported to Power++ using a similar
route planning system, but using a database.

I successfully tried to port this to 32Bit Visual Studio 2022 and it will be integrated later in this repo.
